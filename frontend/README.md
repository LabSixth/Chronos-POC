# ⏱️ Chronos vs. Prophet Stock Price Prediction Microservice

A Streamlit application for visualizing and comparing stock price predictions between Chronos and Prophet forecasting models.

---

## 📚 Overview
This microservice provides a web-based interface for comparing stock price predictions generated by two popular forecasting models:
- **Prophet**: Facebook's time series forecasting library
- **Chronos**: An alternative time series forecasting approach

The application allows users to select dates and compare predicted values with actual stock prices through an intuitive web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive selection between Prophet and Chronos prediction models
- Date selection for viewing specific predictions
- Visualization of predicted prices for nearby dates
- Performance comparison between predicted and actual values
- AWS integration for data ingress from S3

## ⚙️ Architecture
This microservice is designed as a containerized application with the following architecture:
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web application
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: AWS ECS with Fargate
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for model artifacts
- **Access**: AWS Load Balancer

## 🌊 Deployment Flow
1. Application is containerized using Docker
2. Docker image is pushed to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
3. ECS Fargate provisions and runs the container
4. Application is served through a Load Balancer for high availability

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Docker
- AWS account with appropriate permissions

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
``` bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1. Run the application locally:
``` bash
   streamlit run app.py
```
### Docker Deployment

### 🚀 AWS Deployment
1. Authenticate with AWS ECR
2. Push the Docker image to ECR
3. Configure ECS Task Definition and Service
4. Set up the Load Balancer
5. Deploy the service using Fargate

## 🌐 Application Usage
1. Select the prediction model (Prophet or Chronos)
2. Choose a date for which you want to see the prediction
3. View the predicted closing price and trend for nearby dates
4. Examine model performance through visualization charts

## 💾 Data Flow
1. Prediction data is stored in AWS S3
2. Data is fetched using the AWS ingress utility
3. Streamlit application processes and visualizes the data
4. User interactions trigger dynamic updates to the visualizations
